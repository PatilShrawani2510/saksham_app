# IoT-Based Plant Monitoring and Automated Irrigation System

This project presents an IoT-based Plant Monitoring and Automated Irrigation System designed to make plant care more efficient and less dependent on manual intervention. The system uses an ESP8266 microcontroller integrated with soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light sensors to continuously track environmental conditions. Sensor data is processed in real time, and when soil moisture levels fall below a predefined threshold, the ESP8266 activates a relay-controlled water pump and a buzzer alert. The irrigation continues until the soil moisture returns to an optimal level, preventing both under-watering and over-watering. All collected data is uploaded to Google Firebase, which serves as the cloud database, while an Android application provides farmers or users with remote access to plant conditions, including real-time monitoring and manual pump control.

The implementation successfully demonstrated automation of irrigation, accurate sensor readings, and seamless integration with Firebase for real-time data visualization. The Android app improved user convenience by allowing one-click pump control, making the system highly suitable for rooftop gardens, greenhouses, and indoor plant setups. While occasional Wi-Fi disruptions and sensor calibration variations were observed, the overall system reduced human intervention and promoted healthier plant growth.

This project highlights how IoT can be applied to precision agriculture by improving water efficiency and ensuring timely irrigation. It is cost-effective, compact, and scalable, making it suitable for both urban farming and small-scale agriculture. Future improvements may include AI-based predictive irrigation, solar-powered operation to reduce energy dependency, and enhanced sensor calibration techniques for higher accuracy.
