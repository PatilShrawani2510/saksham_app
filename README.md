# SAKSHAM – Android App for Learning and Communication Support in Children with Mild Autism
Overview

SAKSHAM is an Android-based application designed to assist children with mild autism and related developmental challenges. Many children with autism struggle to recognize objects, understand concepts, or communicate effectively. At the same time, therapists face challenges tracking daily progress manually. SAKSHAM bridges this gap by providing a visual, audio, and interactive learning environment while offering therapists intelligent tools to monitor and analyze progress.

The app focuses on creating an engaging, safe, and structured environment for children to learn, communicate, and express themselves, while providing real-time insights for therapists and caregivers.
